## Introduction

I used the current version of the Mos Burger website and updated it while retaining the brand feelings. The current website for Mos Burger Singapore can be improved upon! On the top of the website, there are many social media icons that clutter the brand logo and brand motto.  On a smaller screen, the brand logo is hidden! The navigation bar is barely accessible. With some adjustment to HTML and CSS, the website becomes cleaner and responsive to the user.

## Built with

* CSS

### Outcome for phone:

The navigation bar is hidden when the screen size is small. It can be accessed using the hamburger menu on the top right corner.
